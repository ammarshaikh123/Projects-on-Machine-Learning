    "Some companies are publicly traded, which means that anyone can buy and sell their shares on the open market. A share entitles the owner to some control over the direction of the company, and to some percentage (or share) of the earnings of the company. When you buy or sell shares, it's common to say that you're trading a stock.\n",

For example, Apple stock has a price of 120 dollars per share as of December 2015 -- http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl. A stock that is in less demand, like Ford Motor Company, has a lower price -- http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=F. Stock price is also influenced by other factors, including the number of shares a company has issued.\n",
